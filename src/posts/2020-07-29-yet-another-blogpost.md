This is yet another attempt at this blogging thing. I think this is my third or fourth domain.

Still, I'm back.

This time I promise, as I have unfaithfully done in the past, to blog with consistency. That's a couple of times a week minimum.

I might also occasionally post old articles from the afore-hinted dead domains, hopefully with improvements in both content and style (Only those I'm not embarrassed by at least.)

Expect mostly reflections on programming, electronics, fitness, some philosophy, books and technology. And other things.

See you.

Note: This site is under construction. I'm building a theme for it so you may on occasion see strange things. Consider them [bugs, not features.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undocumented_feature) Be kind enough to tell me.
