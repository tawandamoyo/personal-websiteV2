## Summary:

_Discipline Equals Freedom_ is a field manual for doing hard things. Jocko would know one or two things about that of course, he was a navy seal for 20 years and wakes at dawn every single day.

The goal is to be so disciplined that motivation does not matter. I listened to the audiobook and it was short and enjoyable, with brief lessons and some practical tips on how to live a more disciplined life.

I liked especially the idea of attacking the day early and with exercise, something I've tried to incorporate in my own life, as well as to think about the value and effects of the things I eat (esp sugar). I also liked the part about getting enough sleep and the tips to ensure sufficient and consistent sleeping habits.

The idea of discipline being equal to freedom is an old one. Aristotle mentioned it, saying, "Through discipline comes freedom". So did Rousseau, who argued that liberty is living within the laws we set for ourselves. (I learnt of that courtesy of [this brilliant political philosophy course offered at Yale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhm55mIdSuk)).

Well worth a read, though the ideas and principles are not exactly new. 8/10

## Notes

_The notes below are mine, made while listening to the book, though they are by and large paraphrases of the text. I captured them on Google Keep._
