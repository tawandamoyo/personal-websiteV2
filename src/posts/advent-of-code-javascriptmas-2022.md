I'm taking part in this year's edition of both [JavaScriptmas](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas/-welcome-to-javascriptmas-2022-cv2BLQT8) and [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) to challenge myself and improve my programming.

## Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels. You can solve them in any programming language you choose.

## JavaScriptmas 

JavaScriptmas is another series of challenges from the folks at Scrimba. These are meant to be done in JavaScript but I'm sure for most, if not all, you can use other languages as well.

## Solutions 

I'll be posting my solutions to Github on the repos below, and also here on the blog.
