Lately I have been listening to a lot of podcasts on Artificial Intelligence (AI), and AI Safety. It's been mind-expanding to hear what very smart people think will happen when, not if, we finally get to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

The prognoses, and arguments, range from rapidly expanding economic activity spurred by intelligent agents that are far more capable than us to total annihilation of the human race by AI gone rogue. 

Carl Schuman on [80000 Hours Podcast]() makes a thought provoking case of a future world of AGI. On the other extreme I found []() to make worrying predictions of the dangers of AI.

And in all this I thought also of what the ancients thought would happen if man finally created autonomous machines. The dream of creating human like autonomous agents is ancient, and features in many myths and legends. 

For Aristotle, it would mean cheap and bountiful labor, end the need for slaves, and perhaps usher in a world of leisure and no scarcity. 

Aristotle says, in the Politics:

> We can imagine a situation in which each instrument could do its own work, at the word of command or by intelligent anticipation, like the statues of Daedalus or the tripods made by Hephaestus, of which the poet relates that Of their own motion they entered the conclave of Gods on Olympus.* A shuttle would then weave of itself, and a plectrum would do its own harp-playing. In this situation managers would not need subordinates and masters would not need slaves.

&mdash; Aristotle, <cite>Politics</cite>

The Chinese Daoist text, the Liezi, has an altogether different view. They were on the other extreme, like []. They believed, as many AI researchers now do, that autonomous beings would have their own goals and these might not align with ours. 

The following story from Chapter 6, _The Questions of Tang_ is illustrative. 

> When the entertainment was about to end, the performer winked his eye and beckoned to the concubines in waiting on the King's left and right. The King was very angry, and wanted to execute Yen-shih on the spot. Yen-shih, terrified, at once cut open the performer and took it to pieces to show the King. It was all made by sticking together leather, wood, glue and lacquer,
coloured white, black, red and blue. The King examined it closely; on the inside the liver, gall, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, intestines and stomach, on the outside the muscles, bones, limbs,joints, skin, teeth and hair, were all artificial, but complete without exception. When they were put together, the thing was again as he had seen it before. The King tried taking out its heart,and the mouth could not speak; tried taking out its liver, and the eyes could not see; tried taking out its kidneys, and the feet could not walk. The Kong was at last satisfied, and said with a sigh: 'Is it then possible for human skill to achieve as much as the Creator?'He had it loaded into the second of his cars, and took it back with him

&mdash; <cite>Lieh Tzu</cite>

While the humanoid in Lieh Zi is lecherous, it is also easily dismembered. The same cannot be said for truly capable AGI.
