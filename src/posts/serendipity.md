> To sum up, serendipity is the facility for encountering unexpected good luck, as the result of accident and sagacity, as can occur in the course of more generalized, relatively unfocused exploratory behaviors, even meanderings.

&mdash; James H. Austin, <cite>Chase, Chance, and Creativity: The Lucky Art of Creativity </cite>
