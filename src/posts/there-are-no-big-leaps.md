> There are no big leaps, only developments that look like big leaps to people from the outside because they haven’t seen all of the little steps that comprise them. Even the famous “aha” moments could not exist without a great deal of work to build an edifice that needs just one more piece to make it complete.

&mdash; Anders Ericsson, <cite>Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise</cite>

This is a good reminder to be consistent, do something everyday, get a little bit better every day, put in the hours. There are no big leaps, only little steps.
