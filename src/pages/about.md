I occassinally [blog](blog) and I also write [technical documentation](/projects#technical-documentation).

My main interests are web browsers, web standards, JavaScript, and  communication protocols.

I am a huge proponent of open source, and mostly [use](/uses) free software. 

I have contributed to open source projects including [Matrix](https://matrix.org), [The HTML Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/) and more. You can find more about my [work](/projects).

In my free time I enjoy reading, working out, and thinking about the intersection of technology, AI, and economics.
